# Phrasing!

A inline editing gem, a small CMS substitute for editing live websites. 
It is stacked upon two other gems, Phrasing and Bootstrap-editable-rails, immensely using their codes, so thank you to the authors and all the contributors! 

## Requirements

1. Phrasing expects that your view helpers have a <tt>current_user</tt> method defined.
	
2. Must install the bootstrap gem.

## How to use phrasing?

1. <tt> gem install phrasing </tt>

2. <tt> rake phrasing:install </tt>

	This will create a migration file and a config file. The config file will be placed in the <tt>config/initializers/phrasing.rb</tt> and you will be able to change your HTTP basic auth username and password for editing the live content. 

3. <tt> rake db:migrate </tt>

4. Include the javascript files (most often its your application.js file). It should look something like this:

	```javascript
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require bootstrap
//= require bootstrap-editable
//= require bootstrap-editable-rails
//= require_tree .
	```
  If using bootstrap 3 require <tt>bootstrap-editable-3</tt> instead of <tt>bootstrap-editable</tt>

5. Add to your layout file ( most of the time its your application.html):
```ruby
   = stylesheet_link_tag "phrasing" if current_user
```

6. If you haven't done it yet, require <tt>bootstrap</tt> in your css/scss layout file:
```sass
   //= require bootstrap
```

7. Start with adding your phrases simply by writting in your view file:
```ruby
	phrase('my-first-phrase')
```
  or if you want to update your models attributes, you can use the `model_phrase` helper:
```ruby
  	model_phrase(@post, :title)
```
  Where @post is a object with a title attribute.

8. Whitelist your attributes! (this is only if you are using tbe model_phrase helper).

  In the generated <tt>config/initializers/phrasing.rb</tt> file you can whitelist your model attributes like this:
```ruby
  Phrasing.white_list = ["Project.description", "Project.name"]
```
  or you can whitelist all of them (not recommended) with:
```ruby
  Phrasing.allow_update_on_all_models_and_attributes = true
```
  Note: <tt>PhrasingPhrase.value</tt> is always whitelisted.
