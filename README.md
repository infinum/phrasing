# Phrasing!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/infinum/phrasing.png)](https://travis-ci.org/infinum/phrasing)

Phrasing is a gem for live editing phrases (copy) on websites.

**Phrasing is currently iterating over release candidates for a major update: 4.0. The Readme for those versions can be found** [here](https://github.com/infinum/phrasing/tree/new-release-4)

## Installation

Include the gem in your Gemfile

```ruby
gem "phrasing"
```

Bundle the Gemfile

```ruby
bundle install
```

Run the install script which will create a migration file and a config file.

```ruby
rake phrasing:install
```

Migrate your database
```ruby
rake db:migrate
```

## Setup

The rake task will also generate <tt>phrasing_helper.rb</tt> in your <tt>app/helpers</tt> folder. Here you will need to implement the <tt>can_edit_phrases?</tt> method. Use this to hook-up your existing user authentication system to work with Phrasing.

For example:

```ruby
module PhrasingHelper

  def can_edit_phrases?
    current_user.is_admin?
  end

end
```
Include the phrasing **html** initializer at the top of your application layout file.

```haml
= render 'phrasing/initializer'
```

Include the required **javascript** file:

```javascript
//= require phrasing
```

Include the required **stylesheet** file:

```css
*= require phrasing
```

If you want phrasing to edit your model attributes, you'll need to modify the <tt>phrasing.rb</tt>initializer file in your <tt>app/config/initializers</tt> folder.

To allow phrasing to modify all your models:

```
Phrasing.allow_update_on_all_models_and_attributes = true;
```

To allow phrasing to only modify specific model attributes:

```
Phrasing.whitelist = ["Post.title", "Post.description"]
```

## How to use phrasing?

You can start adding new phrases by simply adding them in your view file:

  = phrase('my-first-phrase')

Aside from editing phrases (basically, Rails translations) you can also edit model attributes inline. Use the same `phrase` method, with the first attribute being the record in question, and the second one the attribute you wish to make editable:

    = phrase(@post, :title)

In the above example, <tt>@post</tt> is the record with a <tt>title</tt> attribute.

## Security

Since Phrasing can be used to update any attribute in any table (using the model_phrase method), special care must be taken into consideration from a security standpoint.

By default, Phrasing doesn't allow updating of any attribute apart from <tt>PhrasingPhrase.value</tt>. To be able to work with other attributes, you need to whitelist them.

In the <tt>config/initializers/phrasing.rb</tt> file you can whitelist your model attributes like this:

```ruby
Phrasing.white_list = ["Post.title", "Post.body"]
```

or you can whitelist all of them (not recommended) with:

```ruby
Phrasing.allow_update_on_all_models_and_attributes = true
```

## Upgrading from version 2.x to 3.x

In versions 3.0.0 and above we have added the Phrasing Versioning System which requires an additional table, so if you are upgrading to a 3.x release, run <tt>rake phrasing:install</tt> to get the additional migration file, then run <tt>rake db:migrate</tt>.

## Turbolinks

If you're experiencing problems with Rails apps using Turbolinks, include the [jQuery-turbolinks](https://github.com/kossnocorp/jquery.turbolinks) gem in your application and simply require it in the following order:

```javascript
//= require jquery
//= require jquery.turbolinks
//= require phrasing
//= require turbolinks
```

## Phrasing Appearance

The `phrase` view helper can take the `options` hash as the last parameter. Features:
```ruby
url: custom_url # point Phrasing to other actions in other controllers
inverse: true # change the hovered background and underline colors to better fit darker backgrounds
class: custom_class # add custom CSS classes to your phrases to change the appearance of phrases in your application
interpolation: { %min: 10 } # add variables to your translations just like w/ I18n
scope: 'homepage.footer' # add scopes just like you would w/ I18.n. If the first argument is 'test', than the key would be 'homepage.footer.test'
```
